            <h3>bankruptcy-prevention</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of bankruptcy based on various financial and operational risk factors. The model should help organizations, investors, and financial analysts identify potential financial distress early and take corrective measures.</p>

            <h4>Conlusion</h4>

            <p>The analysis of this dataset aims to predict bankruptcy using various financial and operational risk factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, we can effectively classify companies based on their likelihood of financial distress.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Smoking significantly increases medical expenses due to higher health risks.

                Higher BMI (obesity) is linked to increased healthcare costs.
                
                Age and number of children influence expenses, with older individuals and those with more dependents incurring higher costs.</p>

            <h3>Electric Car Market</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>Analyze electric vehicle (EV) performance based on acceleration, top speed, range, efficiency, and charging speed.

                Compare different EV brands and models in terms of powertrain, body style, and price.
                
                Identify trends in EV efficiency, charging capabilities, and affordability.
                
                Help consumers and industry professionals make informed decisions about EV purchase and market positioning.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Tesla and premium brands offer better acceleration, range, and fast charging speeds but at a higher price.

                Efficiency (Wh/Km) varies across models, impacting running costs and long-term savings.
                
                Fast charging capability is a key feature for long-distance usability, with significant differences between brands.
                
                Hatchbacks and compact EVs are more affordable but typically have lower range and slower acceleration.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Higher salary individuals tend to afford higher-priced assets, but not all take personal loans.

                Business professionals and salaried employees differ in spending and borrowing habits, with salaried individuals often having higher income stability.
                
                Marital status and number of dependents influence financial decisions, affecting loan approvals and asset purchases.
                
                Education level plays a role, with postgraduates generally earning higher salaries.
