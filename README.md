Fine-tuned hyperparameters and applied feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.

Projects
Bankruptcy-Prevention with Classification Techaniques
Publication

Classification techniques are a subset of supervised machine learning algorithms used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. These techniques are widely used in applications like spam detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and sentiment analysis
EEG Band Discovery

market-segmentation
Publication

This dataset appears to capture customer opinions on food attributes (e.g., spicy, greasy, healthy), along with demographic details (age, gender) and behavioral patterns (visit frequency, like/dislike score). The goal of your analysis—likely using classification models—would be to predict customer preferences based on these attributes

Linear-Regression-for-Medical-Expenses

This dataset contains 1,338 records with information about age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical expenses. The goal of analyzing this data is likely to identify key factors influencing medical insurance costs
Bike Study

 Elictric Car Market-Segmentation-and-Customer-Segmentation-Project

This dataset provides specifications for different electric vehicles, including acceleration, top speed, range, efficiency, charging speed, drivetrain, body style, segment, seating capacity, and price. The goal of analyzing this data could be to compare EV performance, efficiency, and pricing across brands.
